# advent_of_code

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) notebooks/code snippets with input files.

Notebooks created with Google Colaboratory - https://colab.research.google.com/.

2020 (days 6 to 24) - Input files are refered to as `input.txt` for all days. So either the input file for each day of AoC [2020/](2020/) needs to be uploaded to colab runtime root dir as `input.txt` or you upload all files and change the notebook code to read `input<day>.txt` rather than just `input.txt`. You may also upload all files to Google Drive and mount Google Drive as described for 2021 below (also need to change the code to read from the Google Drive location.)

2021, 2024 - Input files for AoC [2021/](2021/) and [2024/](2024/) are expected in your Google Drive in `My Drive/AoC/2021/` and `My Drive/AoC/2024/`. Colab must be given permission to mount your Google Drive.

2022 - Used Scala worksheets instead of Python notebooks. Inputs not downloaded.
